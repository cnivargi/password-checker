            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Why You Should Care About Password Leaks</h2>
            
            <p class="mb-4">
                In 2024 alone, over <strong>5 billion passwords</strong> were leaked in data breaches worldwide. If you're using any of these passwords for your government portals, bank accounts, or email, you're at serious risk.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Here's the scary part: <strong>hackers don't need to hack YOU specifically.</strong> They just need to find your password in a leaked database and try it on popular sites. If you reuse passwords, they can access multiple accounts instantly.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">What Are Data Breaches?</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">
                A data breach happens when hackers steal information from a company's database. This can include:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Usernames and email addresses</li>
                <li>Passwords (sometimes encrypted, sometimes not)</li>
                <li>Personal information (phone numbers, addresses)</li>
                <li>Financial data (in severe cases)</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Major breaches in recent years include LinkedIn (700M accounts), Facebook (530M accounts), and Yahoo (3 billion accounts). In India, several major platforms have been breached, exposing millions of users.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">How Hackers Use Leaked Passwords</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">Once hackers have leaked passwords, they:</p>

            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Credential Stuffing:</strong> Try leaked passwords on other sites (banks, government portals)</li>
                <li><strong>Password Dictionaries:</strong> Add them to lists used in hacking tools</li>
                <li><strong>Targeted Attacks:</strong> Use leaked info to personalize phishing emails</li>
                <li><strong>Account Takeovers:</strong> Access your accounts and lock you out</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-4 my-6">
                <p class="text-red-900 text-sm">
                    <strong>⚠️ Real Example:</strong> Someone reused their password from a gaming site on their Income Tax portal. When the gaming site was breached, hackers accessed their tax account and filed fraudulent returns.

            </div>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">How to Check if Your Password Was Leaked</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">
                We built a free tool that checks your password against <strong>10+ billion leaked passwords</strong> from known data breaches. Here's how it works:
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Step 1: Visit PasswordChecker.in</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Go to <a href="https://www.passwordchecker.in" class="text-indigo-600 underline font-semibold">www.passwordchecker.in</a> and click the "🚨 Leak Check" tab.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Step 2: Enter Your Password</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Type the password you want to check. Don't worry - your password <strong>never leaves your browser</strong>. We use a privacy-safe method called k-Anonymity.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Step 3: Click "Check for Data Breaches"</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The tool will search through billions of leaked passwords and tell you if yours was found.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Step 4: Interpret Results</h3>
            
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>If your password was found:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>The tool shows how many times it appeared in breaches</li>
                <li><strong>Change this password IMMEDIATELY</strong></li>
                <li>Never use it again on any site</li>
                <li>Check all accounts using this password</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mb-4"><strong>If your password was NOT found:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Good! But this doesn't mean it's 100% safe</li>
                <li>Still use unique passwords for each account</li>
                <li>Check again every few months</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">How We Keep Your Password Private</h2>

                    <li>Your browser creates a SHA-1 hash of your password</li>

                    <li>Your browser checks locally if your full hash is in that list</li>

                <li><strong>Change the password on ALL accounts</strong> where you used it</li>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Indian Government Portal Password Safety</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Government portals like UIDAI (Aadhaar), GSTN (GST), Income Tax, and EPFO contain sensitive personal and financial information. If hackers access these accounts, they can:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>File fraudulent tax returns and claim your refunds</li>
                <li>Access your Aadhaar details and commit identity theft</li>
                <li>View your PF balance and make unauthorized withdrawals</li>
                <li>Download your GST invoices and misuse business information</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mb-4">
                <strong>Never reuse passwords on government portals.</strong> Each portal should have a unique, strong password that meets their specific requirements.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">How to Create Safe Passwords</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Instead of using common passwords that might be leaked, create strong, unique passwords using our generator:
            </p>

            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Visit <a href="https://www.passwordchecker.in" class="text-indigo-600 underline">PasswordChecker.in</a></li>
                <li>Click the "⚡ Generate" tab</li>
                <li>Select the portal you need a password for (UIDAI, GSTN, etc.)</li>
                <li>Click "Generate Password"</li>
                <li>Get a strong, memorable password like "Quick7Tiger$42"</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="mb-4">
                These passwords are designed to be:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Strong:</strong> Meet all government portal requirements</li>
                <li><strong>Unique:</strong> Not in any breach databases</li>
                <li><strong>Memorable:</strong> Use words you can remember (unlike random gibberish)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Common Myths About Password Leaks</h2>

            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Myth 1: "I'm not important enough to hack"</strong></p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Reality: Hackers use automated tools. They don't target YOU specifically - they target everyone with leaked passwords.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Myth 2: "If my password was leaked, I'd know about it"</strong></p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Reality: Companies often don't disclose breaches immediately. Some breaches remain unknown for years.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Myth 3: "Changing my password won't help if it's already leaked"</strong></p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Reality: Changing passwords immediately stops hackers from accessing your accounts with the leaked credentials.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Myth 4: "Strong passwords can't be leaked"</strong></p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Reality: Even strong passwords get leaked if the company storing them is breached. Always check.
            </p>
