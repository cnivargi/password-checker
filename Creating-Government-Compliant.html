  <h1>10 Tips for Creating Government-Compliant Passwords</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    In today’s digital environment, individuals and organisations handling government data must adopt strict password policies aligned with official standards. 
    The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) outline rules for secure authentication, 
    identity management, and password protection. The following 10 tips consolidate those requirements into practical actions while testing common assumptions about compliance and real-world security.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Use a Long and Unique Passphrase</h2>
  <p>
    Go beyond the old 8-character rule. A strong passphrase of 12–16 characters or more increases security exponentially. 
    Example: <code>CleanSky+RiverFlow2025</code>.  
    Length trumps complexity — but avoid predictable phrases or public information.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Avoid Dictionary Words and Patterns</h2>
  <p>
    CERT-In and MeitY warn against using names, birthdays, or common words. Attackers exploit predictable content using dictionary and brute-force attacks.  
    Random combinations of unrelated words and characters are safer.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Include Mixed Character Sets — But Don’t Obsess</h2>
  <p>
    Most government systems require at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one number, and one special symbol.  
    The key is randomness, not just pattern compliance. For example, <code>GovT@Road921</code> beats <code>Govt@123</code> even though both meet format rules.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Use a Password Manager</h2>
  <p>
    Password reuse is a major vulnerability. A password manager securely generates and stores unique passwords across services.  
    Government-aligned security frameworks like the GSA and NIST promote password managers as a best practice for credential hygiene.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h2>
  <p>
    Passwords alone are not enough. CERT-In’s 2022 advisories recommend MFA for sensitive systems.  
    Combine passwords with OTPs, security tokens, or biometric factors for layered protection.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Change Passwords Periodically — But Intelligently</h2>
  <p>
    Many policies mandate changes every 90–120 days. However, frequent unnecessary changes lead to weaker passwords.  
    Update credentials after risk events (compromise, role change) or when notified of unusual login activity. Balance is key.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Protect Storage and Avoid Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    Never share credentials through email or chat. Do not store them in plain text or on sticky notes.  
    MeitY guidelines require users to protect authentication data from exposure or delegation.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Enforce Blacklists and Compromise Checks</h2>
  <p>
    Implement systems that reject passwords found in public breaches. CERT-In and ISO-aligned frameworks recommend automated checks to prevent reuse or weak passwords.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Apply Role-Based Access Controls</h2>
  <p>
    High-privilege users (administrators, auditors) must follow stricter password and rotation policies.  
    Segregate accounts by function and use privileged credential vaults to manage sensitive access.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Establish Governance, Training, and Recovery</h2>
  <p>
    Compliance requires user awareness and accountability. Regular security training ensures employees know why password rules exist and how to reset credentials securely.  
    Have a documented recovery process for lost credentials and ensure audit logs capture all password resets.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Government-compliant passwords are not about meeting a checkbox.  
    They are about maintaining confidentiality, accountability, and resilience in the face of evolving threats.  
    Length, uniqueness, MFA, and governance form the four pillars of modern compliance.  
    Remember: the rulebook defines the floor — true security comes from disciplined execution.
